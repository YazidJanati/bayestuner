Description: # Bayesian Optimization Library
        
        BayesTuner optimizes hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms.  It is suited for all sorts of problems.  
        The library is still in its early stage of development.
        
        
        **Example:**
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        from bayestuner.tuner import BayesTuner
        
        tuner = BayesTuner(objective = lambda X : - X[0]**2 - X[1]**2,
                            bounds = [(-5.12,5.12,'continuous')]*2,
                            n_iter = 60,
                            init_samples = 15)
        
        res = tuner.tune(print_score = True)      #Summary of the optimization
        argmax = res.x
        maximum = res.func_value
        ```
        
        You can also optimize on discrete and continuous domains:
        
        ```python
        bounds = [(-5.12,5.12,'continuous'),(-10,10,'discrete')]
        ```
